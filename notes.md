If you want to hide the iframe using CSS specificity based on the iframe's width, the challenge is that CSS does not have a direct way to apply styles based on an element's width; rather, it works based on the viewport width (using media queries). 

However, if you know the iframe's width is tied to the viewport width, you can use media queries. Given the code we have at hand, we've set the iframe to be `55%` of its container. You can use a media query to hide the iframe when the viewport width results in the iframe's width being less than `600px`.

Given that the iframe width is `55%` of the viewport width:

\[
\text{{viewport width}} \times 0.55 = \text{{iframe width}}
\]

So, when the iframe width is `600px`:

\[
\text{{viewport width}} = \frac{{600}}{{0.55}} \approx 1091\text{{px}}
\]

Thus, you can use the following CSS to hide the iframe when the viewport width is less than approximately `1091px`:

```css
@media (max-width: 1090px) {
    iframe {
        display: none;
    }
}
```

This approach works if the iframe width is a direct percentage of the viewport width. If the relationship is more complex due to other styles or elements on the page, then JavaScript would be more versatile for this purpose.

If you wish to use JavaScript to hide the iframe when its width is less than 600px, you can set up an event listener on the `window.resize` event. This will allow you to check the iframe's width each time the window is resized, and hide or display the iframe accordingly.

Here's a simple example using your iframe:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("resize", checkIframeWidth);

// Initial check in case the page is loaded in a small window
checkIframeWidth();

function checkIframeWidth() {
    const iframes = document.querySelectorAll("iframe");

    iframes.forEach(iframe => {
        if (iframe.offsetWidth < 600) {
            iframe.style.display = "none";
        } else {
            iframe.style.display = "block";
        }
    });
}
```

This script will hide all iframes on the page when their width goes below 600px and display them again when it goes above. If you only want to target specific iframes, you can adjust the `querySelectorAll` call or add more specific logic inside the `forEach` loop. 

Remember to include this script at the end of your HTML body or use a `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before the script runs.
